# Design Patterns In Plausible Code

I'll add in this repository examples that showcase design patterns the way people would use them in real software, showing the strengths of each one.

This is opposed to the purely didactical samples you might find online, that have silly situations where the design patterns are not really useful.

I'll try to find the most appropriate example for each design pattern and adapt it to be clear and concise. I found the best ones so far on Wikipedia and on dofactory.com/net/design-patterns.

Eventually I'll cover all of the 23 Gang of Four patterns.

The 7 most important patterns (according to 
medium.com/educative/the-7-most-important-software-design-patterns-d60e546afb0e):

1. **Singleton**: A class of which only a single instance can exist
2. **Factory Method**: Creates an instance of several derived classes ***[done]***
3. **Strategy**: Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class ***[done]***
4. **Observer**: A way of notifying change to a number of classes
5. **Builder**: Separates object construction from its representation
6. **Adapter**: Match interfaces of different classes ***[done]***
7. **State**: Alter an object's behavior when its state changes

All the 23 Gang of Four patterns, from dofactory.com/net/design-patterns :

Creational:
- **Abstract Factory**: Creates an instance of several families of classes
- **Builder**: Separates object construction from its representation
- **Factory Method**: Creates an instance of several derived classes ***[done]***
- **Prototype**: A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned
- **Singleton**: A class of which only a single instance can exist

Structural:
- **Adapter**: Match interfaces of different classes ***[done]***
- **Bridge**: Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation
- **Composite**: A tree structure of simple and composite objects
- **Decorator**: Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
- **Facade**: A single class that represents an entire subsystem
- **Flyweight**: A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
- **Proxy**: An object representing another object

Behavioral
- **Chain of Responsability**: A way of passing a request between a chain of objects
- **Command**: Encapsulate a command request as an object
- **Interpreter**: A way to include language elements in a program
- **Iterator**: Sequentially access the elements of a collection
- **Mediator**: Defines simplified communication between classes
- **Memento**: Capture and restore an object's internal state
- **Observer**: A way of notifying change to a number of classes
- **State**: Alter an object's behavior when its state changes
- **Strategy**: Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class ***[done]***
- **Template Method**: Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass
- **Visitor**: Defines a new operation to a class without change
